These are my 42 School, a coding school that introduced me to the world of programming and software engineering. 🧑‍💻


# Story time 📖
I don't have much coding skill to begin with but one thing I know is **world is changing and I need to keep up** 🌏 
So I started to look for a coding school for beginner. Until I met ***"42School"*** recommended by my consin who
studied data analysis so I gave it a shot. It was tough at first, self/peer-to-peer learning and C language focus 🧑‍💻. 
I was struggled since I got used to learning from instructor/teacher but I kept going 
**"It's not impossible, it's just a new thing"** 😄 

Months later, I got email from the school said I was passed the exam and accepted as a "Cadet" the student of 42 School.
I could not believe that I **started from know nothing about coding nor logic** This is a huge milestone and
sparking point for my coding journey..
